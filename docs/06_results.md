# Results

This section presents a comprehensive visualization of the simulation results generated by the **Fast Marching Tree (FMT)** motion planning stack.
Each scenario represents a unique vehicle configuration and driving style, highlighting how the FMT algorithm adapts its path generation, control strategy, and exploration behavior under consistent simulation conditions.

The following results illustrate the planner’s performance across a spectrum of physical and control constraints, from conservative to aggressive driving profiles.
All simulations were executed using identical initial states, cost functions, and environmental parameters to ensure objective comparison.
To guarantee reproducibility, every run employed a deterministic simulator with fixed random seeds, providing bitwise-consistent outcomes across tests.

## Aggressive

The **Aggressive** configuration represents a high-speed, high-curvature driving mode that prioritizes fast goal-reaching over smoothness.  
It typically uses a shorter planning horizon and a higher acceleration limit.

## Bus

The **Bus** scenario simulates a long-wheelbase vehicle with limited steering angle and slower acceleration dynamics.  
It demonstrates the planner’s ability to handle nonholonomic constraints in large vehicles operating in narrow spaces.

## Conservative

The **Conservative** configuration favors stability and safety, maintaining low curvature and acceleration bounds.  
It is designed to simulate cautious driving styles or heavy-load vehicles that must minimize control effort.

## Sport

The **Sport** setup models agile and responsive handling behavior suitable for fast maneuvering and performance driving.  
It typically operates with higher steering gains, moderate acceleration, and sharper trajectory curvature.

## Van

The **Van** configuration demonstrates moderate-speed motion with medium steering and acceleration limits, representing a balanced driving profile between aggressive and conservative modes.
